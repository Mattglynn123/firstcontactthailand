# Mat Worklog

This is an append-only human-readable index of work completed through Mat's
Codex sessions. Git commit history remains the authoritative technical audit
trail. Each completed request must add one concise entry here in the same commit
as the source change.

## 2026-07-21 - Standalone branch handoff and QA reliability

- Request: prepare the approved staging version for Mat to manage from his own computer.
- Scope: established `codex/standalone-rebuild` as the only working branch, replaced outdated WordPress and old-branch instructions, and added an automatic end-of-task commit/push protocol.
- Reliability: added property image fallbacks and separated third-party image availability warnings from first-party QA failures.
- Verification: Astro built 185 pages; 185 routes and 55 responsive captures passed; 0 broken internal links, 0 route failures, and 0 responsive failures.
- Status: complete; production WordPress and the public staging directory were not modified.

## 2026-07-21 - GitHub Actions duration control

- Request: leave Mat with a reliable automatic GitHub backup and verification workflow.
- Scope: CI now validates all first-party routes, assets, layouts, and responsive captures without waiting for third-party property image payloads.
- Reason: external property image providers caused the otherwise successful audit to exceed GitHub's 15-minute job limit.
- Safety: unavailable provider images still use the local regional fallback; external media remains visible in the QA report as non-blocking warnings.
- Status: complete; no production or staging deployment was performed.
